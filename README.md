# MyScripts

I make python scripts to automate things. One of the python scripts makes bat files that invokes my python scripts. This allows my to treat my python scripts as command line commands, provided the bat files are on the system path. This is really convenient and cool.
I was largely inspired by this website: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ .
